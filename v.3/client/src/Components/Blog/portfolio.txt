Challenges while building Portfolio

This is a large test of what I learned over a year ago... I am relearning how to create a website
but this one is the biggest project of them all. I will be embedding other react, javascript, and
html projects into this mega react portfolio. I've been coming across quite a few bumps really
trying to make sure it also looks good on mobile. Adjusting the previous projects will be one of
the other things I have to do.

Utilizing Yarn to manage the project --- do more reading on what it really does, similar to NPM
Portfolio UI designed using Material UI
React, React-Router-Dom, MySQL

Challenges:
Adjusting view for mobile vs desktop
Spacing, directly affecting certain elements
 - Moving the main content from being under the drawer on desktop
 - Variable sizing for text - sometimes too big on mobile - learned when to use rem and %
 - Stretching picture when resized - alignSelf:"center"

Allowing the project UI to render without porfolio UI interfering

How hosting different projects on the same website works.
Your files stored in the publicHTML folder act as a home directory to the main domain. If you bought the domain example.com and threw in a bunch of random files in that same folder,
you could access those files by the url. If you added img.png to the publicHTML directory, you could access it as example.com/img.png without telling it how to access that.
Accessing files like this definitely doesn't sound very secure if you're storing files under your domain.
