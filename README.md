# V.2
This version of my Portfolio was previously live but I have retired it due to feeling like having a different design and hiding it's incompleteness

Unfortunately, I couldn't find time to dedicate myself to coding because money has been tight with low paying jobs and
just being too tired to focus on it. I never came around to finishing the site and had to focus on living.

## Technologies Used
+ React.js - DOM Manipulation
+ Bootstrap - CSS CDN
+ Axios - I was planning on using this to fetch data from GitHub and display it somewhere

Less is more right? I felt that the less I use other tools, I would build a better foundation in coding.

# V.1
This was one of the first assignments in the UCF Full Stack Coding Boot Camp. 

None of the projects shown are actually completed during the course and are just there for place holder purposes.

This isn't even a real portfolio but could be one.
