# React-Portfolio
 
This was originally a UCF Full Stack Boot Camp assignment to show that students can use the basics of React to create a portfolio.

This is the first React Portfolio I created.
At the time I knew I could use a CSS Framework...
Instead I wanted to do all the styling myself.

It was pretty fun figuring out how to move things around the screen!
