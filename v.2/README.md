# React-Portfolio
 
This was originally a UCF Full Stack Boot Camp assignment to show that students can use the basics of React to create a portfolio.

This is the first React Portfolio I created.
I tried to do most of the styling using only CSS but positioning and making sure it's responsive to mobile was hard.
I ended up using a super popular CSS Framework: Bootstrap
This helped me position icons in the footer quicker and easier than guessing where the icon is gonna end up.
